# WEBPAGE-P02
Landing a webpage.

So this is my second project as per TOP curriculum.
My objective is to land a webpage as per demonstrated.

Breaking down the steps:
1. Dividing each portion of the page into 4 layers mainly + the footer.
2. Add necessary content to each portions, focusing mainly on one-layer at a time.
3. Make sure the contents are correctly positioned.
4. Cross-checking the final out with desired out.
